# EDTECH-ASSIGNMENT-TRACKER
Design and implement a simplified assignment tracking system for an EdTech platform that allows teachers to post assignments and students to submit them.

• Design the system architecture and document:

 • Core entities and their relationships (ER diagram or table descriptions)

 • API endpoints for the following actions:

 • Teacher creates an  assignment

 • Student submits assignment

 • Teacher views submissions

 • Authentication strategy (student vs. teacher roles)

 • Suggestions for scaling the system in the future

Part B: Prototype Implementation

• Implement at least the following APIs:

 • User signup/login (role-based: teacher/student)

 • Create assignment (teacher only)

 • Submit assignment (student only)

 • View submissions (teacher only)

• Technology stack:

 • Use Python with Django, Flask, or FastAPI

 • Store data in SQLite or PostgreSQL

 • Return structured JSON responses

Frontend (Mandatory)

• Basic UI with either plain HTML/CSS/JS or React:

 • Simple form for assignment creation (teacher)

 • Submit assignment page (student)

 • View submissions page (teacher)

Bonus

• Improve the UI (styling, layout, UX)

 • Add file upload support for submissions

 • Include Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
